## [HumHub](https://www.humhub.org/en) Discord Module

Adds a sidebar widget to the Dashboard.

## Installing

1. After you've downloaded the module it is recommended to add your Server ID in manually. [Line 11](https://github.com/Felli/humhub-discordapp-module/blob/master/widgets/views/discordappframe.php#L11)
2. Rename folder to ```discordapp``` (Isn't 100% needed done but some servers may require this!)
3. Enabled the module from your admin panel and you've got yourself a working Discord chat widget.
